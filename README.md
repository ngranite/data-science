## 1. Movie Recommendation System

Online streaming platforms like Netflix have plenty of movies in their repositories and if we can build a recommendation system to recommend relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions, this would improve customer satisfaction and hence improve revenue. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies, it can be any item for which you want to build a recommendation system. For this case study, you can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).

## 2. New York Taxi - Predictive Analysis

New York City taxi rides form the core of the traffic in the city of New York. The many rides taken every day by New Yorkers in the busy city can give us a great idea of traffic times, road blockages, and so on. A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is hassle-free. One of the main issues is predicting the duration of the current ride so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip. Here the data set contains various information regarding the taxi trips, its duration in New York City. We will apply different techniques here to get insights into the data and determine how different variables are dependent on the Trip Duration.

## 3. Pima Indian Tribe - Diabetes Analysis

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
